## Why Cortex Agents?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but without structure they produce inconsistent results. **Cortex Agents** adds the missing layer: a complete development workflow that turns OpenCode into a disciplined engineering partner.

```
 Before                                    After
 ──────                                    ─────
 AI writes code wherever                   AI checks git status first
 No branching discipline                   Creates worktrees/branches automatically
 No documentation                          Generates docs with mermaid diagrams
 No quality checks                         Runs parallel quality gates (6 sub-agents)
 No plan, no traceability                  Plans with acceptance criteria, ships PRs
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx cortex-agents install       # Add plugin + agents + skills
npx cortex-agents configure     # Pick your models interactively
# Restart OpenCode — done.
```

Your OpenCode session now has **12 specialized agents**, **33 tools**, and **17 domain skills**.

> **Built-in Agent Replacement** — Cortex automatically disables OpenCode's native `build` and `plan` agents (replaced by `implement` and `architect`). The `architect` agent becomes the default, promoting a planning-first workflow. Native agents are fully restored on `uninstall`.

---

## Architecture

### Agent Hierarchy

```
User Request
    |
    v
 Architect (read-only planning)
    |
    |-- read-only analysis -----> @security  @coder  @perf
    |
    v
 Implement / Fix (execution)
    |
    |-- REPL Loop (task-by-task) --> build + test per task
    |
    v
 Quality Gate (two-phase)
    |
    |-- Phase 1 (parallel, scope-based):
    |     @testing  @security  @audit  @docs-writer  @devops  @perf
    |
    |-- Phase 2 (cross-agent):
    |     @testing reacts to @security findings
    |
    v
 quality_gate_summary --> GO / NO-GO / GO-WITH-WARNINGS
    |
    v
 Fix blockers --> task_finalize --> PR
```

### The Workflow

```
You: "Add user authentication"

Architect Agent                         reads codebase, creates plan with mermaid diagrams
   saves to .cortex/plans/             commits plan on current branch
   "Plan committed. Proceed?"          offers worktree, branch, or stay

Implement Agent                         loads plan, checks git status
   repl_init → parses tasks + ACs      iterates task-by-task with build+test
   Quality Gate → 6 agents in parallel  testing + security + audit + docs + devops + perf
   quality_gate_summary → GO            aggregates findings, recommends go/no-go
   task_finalize                        stages, commits, pushes, opens PR
```

### Scope-Based Quality Gate

Not every change needs a full audit. The quality gate scales with risk:

| Scope | Criteria | Sub-Agents Launched |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Trivial** | Docs, comments, formatting | `@docs-writer` only (or skip) |
| **Low** | Tests, config files | `@testing` |
| **Standard** | Normal code changes | `@testing` + `@security` + `@audit` + `@docs-writer` |
| **High** | Auth, payments, crypto, infra, DB migrations | All 6: `@testing` + `@security` + `@audit` + `@docs-writer` + `@devops` + `@perf` |

---

## Agents

### Primary Agents (3)

Handle complex, multi-step work. Use your best model.

| Agent | Role | Key Capabilities |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **architect** | Read-only analysis & planning | Plans with mermaid diagrams, acceptance criteria, NFR analysis. Commits plans and defers branch creation to handoff. Delegates read-only analysis to `@security`, `@coder`, `@perf`. |
| **implement** | Full-access development | Skill-aware implementation, REPL loop with ACs, two-phase quality gate, parallel sub-agent orchestration, task finalizer. |
| **fix** | Quick turnaround bug fixes | Rapid diagnosis, scope-based quality gate, optional REPL loop. Delegates deep debugging to `@debug`. |

### Sub-Agents (9)

Focused specialists launched **automatically** by primary agents. Each auto-loads domain skills for deeper analysis. Use a fast/cheap model.

| Agent | Role | Auto-Loads Skill | Triggered By |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **@testing** | Test writing, suite execution, coverage | `testing-strategies` | Implement (standard+high), Fix (low+standard+high) |
| **@security** | OWASP audit, secrets scan, threat modeling | `security-hardening` | Implement (standard+high), Fix (standard+high), Architect (read-only) |
| **@audit** | Code quality, tech debt, pattern review | `code-quality` | Implement (standard+high) |
| **@docs-writer** | Auto-documentation generation | — | Implement (standard+high) |
| **@perf** | Complexity analysis, N+1 detection, bundle impact | `performance-optimization` | Implement (high), Fix (high), Architect (read-only) |
| **@devops** | CI/CD validation, IaC review | `deployment-automation` | Implement (high, or infra files changed) |
| **@coder** | Cross-layer implementation, feasibility | Per-layer skills | Implement (3+ layers), Architect (feasibility analysis) |
| **@refactor** | Behavior-preserving restructuring | `design-patterns` + `code-quality` | Implement (refactor plans) |
| **@debug** | Root cause analysis, troubleshooting | `testing-strategies` | Fix (complex issues) |

Sub-agents return **structured reports** with severity levels (`BLOCKING`, `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) that the orchestrating agent uses to decide whether to proceed or fix issues first.

### Skill Routing

All agents detect the project's technology stack and **automatically load relevant skills** before working:

```
Implement Agent detects: package.json has React + Express + Prisma
  -> auto-loads: frontend-development, backend-development, database-design, api-design
  -> implements with deep framework-specific knowledge
```

## Tools

33 tools bundled and auto-registered. No configuration needed.

<table>
<tr><td width="50%">

**Git Workflow**
- `branch_status` — Current branch + change detection
- `branch_create` — Convention-named branches (with toast)
- `branch_switch` — Safe branch switching
- `worktree_create` — Isolated worktree in `.worktrees/`
- `worktree_list` / `worktree_remove` / `worktree_open`

</td><td width="50%">

**Planning & Sessions**
- `plan_save` / `plan_load` / `plan_list` / `plan_delete`
- `plan_commit` — Commit plan artifacts on current branch (branch creation deferred to handoff)
- `session_save` / `session_list` / `session_load`
- `cortex_init` / `cortex_status` / `cortex_configure`

</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">

**Documentation**
- `docs_init` — Set up `docs/` structure
- `docs_save` — Save doc with mermaid diagrams
- `docs_list` — Browse all docs
- `docs_index` — Rebuild `docs/INDEX.md`

</td><td width="50%">

**Finalization**
- `task_finalize` — Stage, commit, push, create PR
  - Auto-detects worktree (targets main)
  - Auto-populates PR from `.cortex/plans/`
  - Auto-links issues via `Closes #N`
- `quality_gate_summary` — Aggregate sub-agent findings, GO/NO-GO recommendation

</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">

**GitHub Integration**
- `github_status` — Check `gh` CLI availability, auth, and detect projects
- `github_issues` — List/filter repo issues by state, labels, milestone, assignee
- `github_projects` — List GitHub Project boards and their work items

The architect uses these to browse your backlog and seed plans from real issues. Issue numbers stored in plan frontmatter (`issues: [42, 51]`) are automatically appended as `Closes #N` to the PR body.

</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">

**REPL Loop** — Iterative task-by-task implementation
- `repl_init` — Initialize loop from plan (parses tasks + ACs, auto-detects build/test)
- `repl_status` — Current progress, active task with ACs, retry counts
- `repl_report` — Report outcome (`pass`/`fail`/`skip`) with auto-retry and escalation
- `repl_resume` — Detect and resume interrupted loop from previous session
- `repl_summary` — Markdown results table with AC satisfaction for PR body

State persists to `.cortex/repl-state.json` — survives context compaction, session restarts, and agent switches.

## Model Configuration

Cortex agents are **model-agnostic**. Configure globally or per-project:

```bash
npx cortex-agents configure            # Global (all projects)
npx cortex-agents configure --project  # Per-project (saves to .opencode/models.json)
```

```
? Select model for PRIMARY agents (architect, implement, fix):
  Claude Sonnet 4    (anthropic)     Best balance of intelligence and speed
  Claude Opus 4      (anthropic)     Most capable, best for complex architecture
  GPT-4.1            (openai)        Fast multimodal model
  Gemini 2.5 Pro     (google)        Large context window, strong reasoning
  Kimi K2P5          (kimi)          Optimized for code generation
  Enter custom model ID

? Select model for SUBAGENTS (debug, coder, testing, security, devops, audit, ...):
  Claude 3.5 Haiku   (anthropic)     Fast and cost-effective
  o4 Mini            (openai)        Fast reasoning, cost-effective
  Gemini 2.5 Flash   (google)        Fast and efficient
  Same as primary
```

Agents can also configure models mid-session via `cortex_configure` — no need to leave OpenCode.

## How It Works

### Implement Agent — Step by Step

```
Step 1   branch_status           Am I on a protected branch?
Step 2   cortex_status           Is .cortex initialized?
Step 3   plan_list / plan_load   Is there a plan for this work?
Step 4   Ask: strategy           Worktree (recommended) or branch?
Step 5   Execute                 Create worktree/branch
Step 6   REPL Loop               repl_init -> iterate tasks one-by-one
  6a     repl_init               Parse tasks + ACs, detect build/test commands
  6b     repl_status             Get current task with ACs, auto-advance
  6c     Implement task          Write code to satisfy acceptance criteria
  6d     Build + test            Run detected build/test commands
  6e     repl_report             Report pass/fail/skip -> auto-advance or retry
  6f     Loop                    Repeat 6b-6e until all tasks complete
Step 7   Quality Gate            Two-phase sub-agent review (scope-based)
  7a     repl_summary            Generate loop results
  7b     Assess scope            Classify changed files by risk tier
  7c     Phase 1                 Launch sub-agents in parallel
  7d     Phase 2                 Cross-agent reactions (@testing <- @security)
  7e     quality_gate_summary    Aggregate findings -> GO / NO-GO
Step 8   Documentation           Review @docs-writer output or prompt user
Step 9   session_save            Record what was done and why
Step 10  task_finalize           Commit, push, create PR (with quality gate in body)
Step 11  Cleanup                 Remove worktree if applicable
```

### REPL Loop Example

```
repl_init("my-plan.md")
  -> Parses tasks (- [ ] checkboxes) with ACs (- AC: lines)
  -> Auto-detects: npm run build, npx vitest run
  -> Creates .cortex/repl-state.json

Loop:
  repl_status              -> "Task #1: Implement user model"
                               AC: User model has name, email, password
                               AC: Email validation rejects malformed addresses
  [implement task]
  [run build + tests]
  repl_report(pass, "42 tests pass")
                           -> "Task #1 PASSED (1st attempt)"
                           -> "Next: Task #2"

  repl_status              -> "Task #2: Add API endpoints"
  [implement task]
  [run build + tests]
  repl_report(fail, "POST /users 500")
                           -> "Task #2 FAILED (attempt 1/3)"
                           -> "Fix and retry. 2 retries remaining."
  [fix issue, re-run tests]
  repl_report(pass, "All green")
                           -> "Task #2 PASSED (2nd attempt)"
  ...

repl_summary               -> Markdown table for PR body
```

### Quality Gate Example

```
quality_gate_summary receives reports from 6 agents:
  @testing:     PASS — 12 tests written, all passing
  @security:    PASS WITH WARNINGS — 1 medium finding (XSS in tooltip)
  @audit:       PASS — score A, no critical issues
  @docs-writer: 1 feature doc created
  @devops:      N/A
  @perf:        PASS — no regressions, all O(n) or better

  -> Recommendation: GO-WITH-WARNINGS
  -> Blocker: none
  -> PR body section auto-generated
```
