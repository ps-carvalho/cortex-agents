# Testing Strategies Skill

This skill provides patterns and best practices for writing effective tests.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Setting up testing infrastructure
- Writing new tests
- Improving test coverage
- Debugging test failures
- Choosing testing tools

## Testing Fundamentals

### The Testing Pyramid
- Unit tests (70%) - Fast, isolated, cheap
- Integration tests (20%) - Medium speed, test interactions
- E2E tests (10%) - Slow, realistic, expensive

### Test Quality Attributes
- Fast (< 100ms per test ideally)
- Independent (no shared state)
- Repeatable (same results every time)
- Self-validating (pass/fail clearly)
- Timely (written with or before code)

## Unit Testing

### Best Practices
- Test one concept per test
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and errors

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Calculator', () => {
  describe('add', () => {
    it('should return sum of two positive numbers', () => {
      // Arrange
      const calc = new Calculator();
      
      // Act
      const result = calc.add(2, 3);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe(5);
    });
    
    it('should handle negative numbers', () => {
      const calc = new Calculator();
      const result = calc.add(-2, -3);
      expect(result).toBe(-5);
    });
  });
});
```

### Mocking Strategies
- Mock external APIs
- Mock database calls
- Mock file system operations
- Mock time (Date.now)
- Mock randomness

## Integration Testing

### Database Testing
- Use test database (in-memory or dedicated)
- Reset state between tests
- Test transactions
- Verify data integrity
- Test migrations

### API Testing
- Test all endpoints
- Verify status codes
- Check response schemas
- Test authentication
- Test error scenarios

### Component Testing
- Render components in isolation
- Test user interactions
- Verify state changes
- Check accessibility
- Test responsive behavior

## End-to-End Testing

### Best Practices
- Test critical user journeys
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Use data-testid attributes
- Handle async operations
- Clean up test data

### Test Scenarios
- User registration/login
- Complete purchase flow
- CRUD operations
- Search functionality
- File uploads

### Tools
- Playwright (recommended)
- Cypress
- Selenium
- Puppeteer

## Test Coverage

### Goals by Layer
- Business logic: >90%
- Utilities: >80%
- Components: >70%
- API routes: >80%
- Integration points: >75%

### Coverage Reports
- Use coverage tools (Istanbul, c8)
- Track trends over time
- Focus on meaningful coverage
- Don't chase 100% blindly
- Identify untested critical paths

## Testing Tools by Language

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Jest or Vitest (unit)
- React Testing Library (components)
- Playwright (e2e)
- MSW (API mocking)

### Python
- pytest (unit/integration)
- pytest-asyncio (async)
- factory-boy (fixtures)
- Playwright (e2e)

### Go
- Testing package (built-in)
- Testify (assertions)
- GoMock (mocking)
- Playwright (e2e)

### Rust
- Built-in test framework
- Mockall (mocking)
- Playwright (e2e)
